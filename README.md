# kevlar9

Description: Selling a snapchat "hacking" service. He told his method was phishing. Later on told me it wasn't phishing. Claims the only coding languages he knows is C++ and Malbolge. Which is weird right? A phishing site without any knowledge of html5, css, js, php. Wow. I called him out for it he tried to deny. But yeah. Don't trust him.
